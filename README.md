Uber is a ride-sharing app that has its inception in the 2008 financial crisis. Uber is an app that allows people to conveniently hail a CHEAP cab using an app, and it helps people with a car to get a SECOND income.

## Context 
Visualizing Uber's ridership growth in NYC during the period characterize the demand based on identified patterns in the time series estimate the value of the NYC market for Uber, and its revenue growth other insights about the usage of the service
attempt to predict the demand's growth beyond 2014.

- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Basemap](http://matplotlib.org/basemap/)

You will also need to have software installed to run and execute a [Jupyter Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)

If you do not have Python installed yet, it is highly recommended that you install the [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) distribution of Python, which already has the above packages and more included. Make sure that you select the Python 3.x installer.

## Code
All the code is in the notebook `UberAnalysis.ipynb`.

## Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory titanic_survival_exploration/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```

or
```
ipython notebook UberAnalysis.ipynb
```
This will open the Jupyter Notebook software and project file in your web browser.
